#### METEOR API VISUALISATION

The app renders all the meteor hits in nasa's meteor api and plots them onto a scatter graph. Then also each meteor has it's own card where more info is displayed on that specific crash site.

#### API USED

- [NASA](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh) - Meteorite landings

#### Visualisation

The app uses Charts JS to render all the 35,000+ meteor hits that nasa has logged on its api and interestingly it forms a earth/map like scatter graph. Shows just how often the earth is hit by meteors!
